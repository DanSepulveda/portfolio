                    "My name is Daniel Sepúlveda, and I am a Full Stack web developer with knowledge of MERN Stack. My interest in constantly learning new things, together with the search for a change in my work life, led me to this programming world and I found a passion in it. Fortunately, I can say that it was one of the best decisions I have ever made, since programming and being able to develop a product that solves a problem is something that makes me happy. I am currently looking for my first job in the IT world while I keep learning in a self-taught way."

I was able to develop several projects both in a group and individually, always meeting deadlines and holding feedback meetings. I also had the opportunity to work as a Team Leader in the two group projects that we had to develop."
